Implementation of Wasserstein barycenter stuff

My goal with this project is to be able to do a sort of k-means clustering on Google Quick Draw! data.
It would be cool to see what the "5 types of lightbulbs" look like, or similar.

If that doesn't work out, at the very least I want to be able to do k=2 clustering on 7s to find that there are two types of sevens:
- The typical computer "7"
- The version with a horizontal line through the stem

I'm also hoping to learn better time management by keeping track of how long I spend on this, and only working on it for 1-2 hours at a time. I'm looking to spend at most 24 hours on achieving the goals of this project (ofc I might spend several hours afterwards playing around with other applications). But more ideally, a goal of ~10 hours seems reasonable with me working at a normal pace. And I also want to get a better sense of how long projects like this take me, and that it's reasonable for something like this to take say 10 hours.
